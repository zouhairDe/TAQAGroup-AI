# TAQA Morocco - Industrial Anomaly Management System

> A centralized digital platform for tracking, managing, and resolving critical anomalies in TAQA Morocco's industrial units.

## üéØ Problem Statement

In TAQA Morocco's industrial units, critical anomalies‚Äîunexpected events or malfunctions‚Äîare currently tracked through fragmented and often manual systems (e.g., Oracle exports, Maximo entries, Excel sheets). This decentralization reduces visibility and makes tracking, prioritizing, and resolving these anomalies inefficient.

### Current Challenges
- **Delayed decisions and responses**
- **Missed learning opportunities** from past anomalies
- **Poor traceability** of resolution efforts
- **Difficulty aligning** anomalies with planned maintenance

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Objectives
